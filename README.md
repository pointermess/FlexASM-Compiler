# FlexAssembler-Compiler-RC2
This repository contains the new FlexAssembler compiler which is open source and written in modern C++.

The reasons for the complete rewrite are following:
- To provide an open source assembler written in modern C++.
- To add features which were not easily possible with the first version.
- To use the things I learned from writing the first (two) version(s).
- And most important, to learn modern C++.

### How to run?

``flasm.exe INPUT_FILE_PATH OUTPUT_FILE_PATH``
